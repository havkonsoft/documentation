# Install Oracle VM VirtualBox

Download Oracle VM VirtualBox from the
[download page](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and instal the
application for your system.

You are not required to use any system images at this point, because all of the
system images will be installed and configured via Vagrant.
